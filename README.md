# Automated Slide Decks with officer

This repo houses materials (code, data, vignette) to demonstrate how to use the officer package for automated PowerPoint slide generation. More information on officer can be found here: [https://ardata-fr.github.io/officeverse/officer-for-powerpoint.html](https://ardata-fr.github.io/officeverse/officer-for-powerpoint.html)

Files include:
* `Automated_slide_decks_with_officer.Rmd` and corresponding `.html`: step-by-step vignette with code to generate a slide deck with officer. The code creates three slides that are a mix of text, images, and plots (both editable and static)
    * _Note_. The vignette uses [groundhog](https://groundhogr.com/) for R package version control.
* `slide-deck-officer-template.pptx`: the PowerPoint template referenced in the vignette.
* `officer_demo_cat_data.xlsx`: a toy dataset of cat encounters in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) used to generate text and plots in the deck
* `mr_jones2.png` & `mr_jones4.png`: stickers of Mr. Jones (feline), who is featured in the cat encounters deck
* `Cat Encounters_GTA Numbers_01-Apr-2022 to 31-Mar-2023.pptx`: the PowerPoint deck created by the vignette code
* `RLadies_Toronto_Automated slide decks with the officeverse.pdf`: presentation of these materials given at [R-Ladies Toronto](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-toronto/) in April 2024
